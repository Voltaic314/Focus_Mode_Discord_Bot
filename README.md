# Focus_Mode_Discord_Bot
This is just a repository for a discord bot made for our study fam discord server. The focus mode hides all the channels until you have the role removed.  This bot gives and takes away that role.


This python discord bot is a collection of different ever-growing functionalities. 

Current functionalities: 

1. Focus mode - allows the user to go into a focus mode (focus role) that blocks out certain channels from the discord server so that they can spend less time distracted.

2. Auto-Deletion channel functionality. This clears all messages in a channel automatically after they have been sent more than 24 hours ago, unless the message is pinned.

3. Self care reminders - automatically post, at random intervals, for the user to stay hydrated and keep their posture upright. At most this would post every hour, at minimum every 4 hours.

4. Question of the day - this bot will post a conversation starter question of the day from a txt file of given questions. Feel free to supply your own text file here if you wish.

5. Dr K Content Pings for every time healthy gamer uploads a YouTube video, YT Short, or starts a live stream on YT or Twitch.
